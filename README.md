## Reflection

This project was created after reading and learning mail chimps api documentations, I wanted to create a projet where I can pass user data to a another server.

I set out to create a website where a user can type in their full name and email which would be used to subscribe to a newsletter, once subscribed I can send many emails and alert to the users using the mail chimp services.

The tools I used to build the project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js and Express.js.
